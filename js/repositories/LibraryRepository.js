 * LibraryRepository.js — Library Repository | نظام الحسام للمحاماة
 * ================================================================
 * V10 — Offline First Architecture
 * PHASE 5 — SUB-PHASE 5.9.2 — Library Repository
 *
 * Source of design (no assumption outside these — see Input Gap in
 * Library_Repository_Report.md):
 *   - Repository_Contract_Report_PHASE2_V10.md  (Contract §3, Standards §19 —
 *     literal operation names, no synonyms)
 *   - Data_Schema_Specification_Report_PHASE4_V10.md (§4.8 Library: Primary
 *     Key, Required Fields, Search/Sort/Filter Fields, Delete/Sync Rules)
 *   - js/core/Repository.js (Repository Core — Phase 5.1, extended here,
 *     never modified)
 *   - js/repositories/CasesRepository.js, ClientsRepository.js,
 *     ChildrenRepository.js, SessionsRepository.js, TasksRepository.js,
 *     FeesRepository.js, DocumentsRepository.js (Phases 5.2–5.8 — the
 *     pattern reused again here: temporary localStorage Adapter, additive
 *     insert/remove/filter/sort/validate wrappers, documented deviations
 *     resolved in favor of actual runtime behavior — none of these seven
 *     files read for implementation details beyond this reused pattern;
 *     none modified, none imported from)
 *   - Direct inspection of js/modules/library.js (actual current runtime
 *     behavior of saveLibBook()/deleteLibBook()/editLibBook()/
 *     renderLibrary() — ground truth for the "100% Behavior Compatible"
 *     requirement of this phase)
 *   - Direct inspection of index.html (FIELDS.library / MAP.library field
 *     definitions, `data.library` localStorage wiring, `#searchLibrary`,
 *     `#filterLibCat`, `#filterLibType`)
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * INPUT GAP
 *   `docs/Library_Repository_Audit_Report.md` (item 1 of the required
 *   read-first list) is NOT present anywhere in the delivered archive —
 *   no file of that name, and no other file documenting a dedicated
 *   Library Repository audit, exists. Per this phase's own "DO NOT GUESS"
 *   instruction, this is recorded here rather than silently assumed away.
 *   Nearest verified sources used instead, exactly as `NEXT_PHASE.md`'s own
 *   Library section (written at the end of SUB-PHASE 5.8) already
 *   anticipated and flagged for direct re-verification:
 *     - `Data_Schema_Specification_Report_PHASE4_V10.md` §4.8 (Library) —
 *       present and used.
 *     - Direct inspection of `js/modules/library.js` — present and used;
 *       this is the actual ground truth for every runtime-behavior claim
 *       below, since no Library-specific audit report exists to cross-check
 *       against.
 *   Full detail in `Library_Repository_Report.md`, Input Gap section.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The eighth concrete, entity-aware Repository. It subclasses the generic
 *   Repository base class (js/core/Repository.js) and adds ONLY Library
 *   business knowledge: the "id" identifier field (a genuine generic hybrid
 *   id — the FIRST entity in this migration order to actually use `id`
 *   rather than an Arabic-named field, confirmed by direct inspection of
 *   saveLibBook() — see "IDENTIFIER" note below), the single field ACTUALLY
 *   required today by saveLibBook() (`العنوان`, trimmed), the actual
 *   free-text search behavior enforced today by renderLibrary(), and the
 *   two real, live filter controls already wired to `#filterLibCat`/
 *   `#filterLibType`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
 *   - It does NOT modify js/core/Repository.js,
 *     js/repositories/CasesRepository.js, js/repositories/ClientsRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ChildrenRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/SessionsRepository.js, js/repositories/TasksRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/FeesRepository.js, or
 *     js/repositories/DocumentsRepository.js.
 *   - It does NOT modify js/modules/library.js, js/modules/cases.js,
 *     js/modules/clients.js, js/modules/children.js,
 *     js/modules/sessions.js, js/modules/tasks.js, js/modules/fees.js,
 *     js/modules/documents.js, js/modules/templates.js,
 *     js/modules/dashboard.js, js/modules/settings.js, index.html, any CSS,
 *     or Code_v4.gs.
 *   - It is NOT wired into index.html in this phase (no <script> tag
 *     references it) — pure additive file, inert until a later Migration
 *     Contract stage (Repository_Contract_Report.md §16).
 *   - It does NOT implement IndexedDB and does NOT call or reference
 *     DatabaseService or ApiService (no `syncToSheets()`/`API_URL`
 *     dependency — Library never synced in the original, and this
 *     Repository never syncs either; see "SYNC" note below).
 *   - It does NOT transfer any Business Logic (grid/card HTML rendering,
 *     Drive-link bar building, category-tab generation, modal wiring) out
 *     of js/modules/library.js — that stays exactly where it is, untouched.
 *   - It does NOT add any Cache or Sync layer of any kind.
 *
 * IDENTIFIER — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.8 documents the
 *   Primary Key abstractly as `id` (Hybrid) — unlike every entity from
 *   Clients (5.3) through Documents (5.8), which all turned out to use a
 *   dedicated Arabic field name once inspected directly, `NEXT_PHASE.md`
 *   flagged Library as possibly the FIRST entity to actually match this
 *   abstract description literally. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL
 *   saveLibBook() in js/modules/library.js confirms this:
 *     obj['id']              = obj['id']              || uid();
 *     obj['تاريخ_الإنشاء']   = obj['تاريخ_الإنشاء']   || new Date().toISOString();
 *   — the generated identifier really is stored under the generic key
 *   "id", not an Arabic business-field name. This is independently
 *   consistent with Library having no corresponding Code_v4.gs sheet at all
 *   (see "SYNC" note) — there is no sheet header naming convention to
 *   reconcile against, unlike every synced entity so far.
 *   `idField: 'id'` is configured accordingly, with a `_resolveId()`
 *   override generating a local uid()-equivalent value only when `id` is
 *   absent on create() — replicating saveLibBook()'s `|| uid()` fallback
 *   exactly, same override pattern as every prior Repository (not imported
 *   from any of them — see "NAMING/independence" note below).
 *
 * VALIDATION — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.8 lists a single
 *   Required Field: `العنوان`. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL saveLibBook()
 *   (js/modules/library.js) confirms exactly this:
 *     var t = document.getElementById('fLibTitle').value.trim();
 *     if (!t) { toast('يرجى إدخال العنوان', 'error'); return; }
 *   — a single field, checked WITH `.trim()` before the emptiness check
 *   (rejects whitespace-only titles). `_validate()` below applies the same
 *   "non-empty after trim" rule, matching the live form check exactly. No
 *   other field (`الرابط` included) is validated in any way by the live
 *   code — Data_Schema_Specification §4.8's "لا يوجد قيد خاص" (no special
 *   constraint) for every other field is confirmed by direct inspection,
 *   not merely assumed; in particular `الرابط` has no URL-format check,
 *   same pattern already established for Documents' `رابط_Drive` (5.8).
 *
 * SEARCH — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.8 states the Search
 *   Fields are `العنوان` and `الوصف`. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL
 *   current renderLibrary() (js/modules/library.js) shows the claim
 *   UNDERSTATES the real behavior — same recurring pattern as every prior
 *   entity from Cases (5.2) through Documents (5.8), now the eighth
 *   consecutive occurrence: it is not scoped to two fields, it is the same
 *   full-record free-text join pattern:
 *     var rows = data.library.filter(function(b) {
 *       var t = Object.values(b).join(' ').toLowerCase();
 *       return (!s || t.includes(s)) && (!cF || b['القسم'] === cF) && (!tF || b['النوع'] === tF);
 *     });
 *   bound to a real, live UI search box (`#searchLibrary`). This phase's
 *   own OVERRIDES section is explicit and literal about `_matchesSearch()`:
 *   "Current behavior must remain identical. Search across ALL values
 *   using Object.values(record). Exactly like library.js." Unlike every
 *   prior Repository (Cases through Documents), which each scoped their
 *   `_matchesSearch` override to a curated legacy-field list explicitly
 *   EXCLUDING the new audit/metadata fields this Repository layer
 *   introduces (createdAt/updatedAt/deletedAt/version/syncVersion/
 *   checksum), `_matchesSearch` below deliberately does NOT exclude them —
 *   it calls `Object.values(record)` on the record AS GIVEN, literally
 *   matching `renderLibrary()`'s own unscoped `Object.values(b)` call, per
 *   this phase's explicit instruction, which takes priority over the
 *   audit-field-exclusion convention established in Phases 5.2–5.8. A
 *   practical, documented consequence: once a record has passed through
 *   this Repository's create()/update() and been stamped with metadata
 *   (§3.9/§3.10), searching for a substring of its own `checksum` (or any
 *   other audit field value) WILL match it — a new behavior relative to
 *   the pre-Repository `data.library` array (which never had these fields
 *   at all), but not a divergence from this phase's literal instruction.
 *
 * FILTER — Data_Schema_Specification §4.8 documents Filter Fields for
 *   Library as `النوع` and `القسم`. UNLIKE Fees (Phase 5.7, zero live filter
 *   controls) and MORE like Documents/Tasks (one live control each), direct
 *   inspection of index.html and renderLibrary() confirms Library has TWO
 *   real, live filter controls today: `#filterLibType` (a fixed-option
 *   `<select>`, `onchange="renderLibrary()"`, exact-equality against
 *   `النوع`) and `#filterLibCat` — the latter notably NOT a fixed-option
 *   dropdown like every filter control seen in any prior entity, but one
 *   whose `<option>` list is rebuilt on every renderLibrary() call directly
 *   from the current distinct `القسم` values present in `data.library`
 *   itself (`[...new Set(data.library.map(...).filter(Boolean))]`). This
 *   dynamic-options mechanism is a rendering-time UI concern only — it does
 *   not change the underlying filter semantics (`!cF || b['القسم'] === cF`
 *   is still a plain exact-equality match once a value is selected), so no
 *   Library-specific override of the generic engine is needed for `filter()`
 *   itself; both fields already work through the base class's generic
 *   range/equality engine, same as every prior Repository's additive
 *   `filter()` wrapper.
 *
 * SORT — Data_Schema_Specification §4.8 lists `العنوان` as the Sort Field.
 *   Direct inspection of the ACTUAL current renderLibrary() shows NO
 *   `.sort()` call exists at all — library rows render in `data.library`
 *   insertion order only, identical in kind to Children's (5.4), Tasks'
 *   (5.6), Fees' (5.7), and Documents' (5.8) findings. Because this phase's
 *   explicit priority is behavior compatibility, the additive `sort()`
 *   method below does not replace or emulate any existing behavior — it is
 *   a genuinely new capability, defaulting to `العنوان` ascending exactly as
 *   Data_Schema_Specification recommends, since no real behavior exists to
 *   contradict it.
 *
 * SYNC — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.8 documents Library's Sync
 *   Priority as "معطَّل بالكامل تصميماً (Local-only-by-design)" — fully
 *   disabled BY DESIGN, not a gap. This is independently confirmed by
 *   `js/modules/library.js`'s own file-header comment ("GAS Sheet name:
 *   none — Library has NO backend sync... Library data is local-only
 *   (localStorage), by original design — confirmed by full-file scan") and
 *   by direct inspection of saveLibBook()/deleteLibBook(), neither of which
 *   calls syncToSheets()/ApiService.syncRow()/ApiService.deleteData() at
 *   all. This is a materially different situation from the
 *   Documents/Tasks/Fees delete-sync GAPS (§11 of PROJECT_STATE.md) — those
 *   entities DO have a real corresponding Sheet that create/update syncs to
 *   but delete does not; Library has no corresponding Sheet at all, at any
 *   point in its lifecycle. This Repository adds no Sync layer of any kind,
 *   consistent with every prior Repository (none of which sync either) —
 *   it is a pure localStorage CRUD layer.
 *
 * NAMING / independence — same reconciliation as every prior concrete
 *   Repository (see their own "NAMING"/"IDENTIFIER" notes): every
 *   Contract-literal method (create/update/delete/get/getAll/find/exists/
 *   count/bulkInsert/bulkUpdate/bulkDelete/search/export/import/clear/
 *   transaction) is inherited UNCHANGED from Repository.prototype.
 *   insert()/remove()/filter()/sort()/validate() are additive convenience
 *   wrappers, not renamed or removed Contract methods. This file does not
 *   import or reference CasesRepository.js/ClientsRepository.js/
 *   ChildrenRepository.js/SessionsRepository.js/TasksRepository.js/
 *   FeesRepository.js/DocumentsRepository.js in any way — its local
 *   uid()-equivalent generator and Storage Adapter are self-contained
 *   duplicates of the same pattern, not shared code.
 *
 * Load order: additive file, not yet wired into index.html. Depends only on
 * js/core/Repository.js having been loaded first (throws a clear error
 * otherwise — see guard below).
