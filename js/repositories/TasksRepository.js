 * TasksRepository.js — Tasks Repository | نظام الحسام للمحاماة
 * ================================================================
 * V10 — Offline First Architecture
 * PHASE 5 — SUB-PHASE 5.6 — Tasks Repository
 *
 * Source of design (no assumption outside these — see Input Gap in
 * Tasks_Repository_Report.md):
 *   - Repository_Contract_Report_PHASE2_V10.md  (Contract §3, Catalog §4.6,
 *     Standards §19 — literal operation names, no synonyms)
 *   - Data_Schema_Specification_Report_PHASE4_V10.md (§4.6 Tasks: Primary
 *     Key, Required Fields, Search/Sort/Filter Fields, Delete/Sync Rules)
 *   - js/core/Repository.js (Repository Core — Phase 5.1, extended here,
 *     never modified)
 *   - js/core/CasesRepository.js, js/repositories/ClientsRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ChildrenRepository.js, js/repositories/SessionsRepository.js
 *     (Phases 5.2/5.3/5.4/5.5 — the pattern reused again here: temporary
 *     localStorage Adapter, additive insert/remove/filter/sort/validate
 *     wrappers, documented deviations resolved in favor of actual runtime
 *     behavior — none of these four files read for implementation details
 *     beyond this pattern; none modified, none imported from)
 *   - Direct inspection of js/modules/tasks.js (actual current runtime
 *     behavior of saveTask()/deleteTask()/toggleTask()/renderTasks() —
 *     ground truth for the "100% Behavior Compatible" requirement of this
 *     phase)
 *   - Direct inspection of index.html (FIELDS.tasks / MAP.tasks field
 *     definitions, `data.tasks` localStorage wiring, the #filterTaskPriority
 *     dropdown — no #filterTaskStatus exists)
 *   - Direct inspection of Code_v4.gs (SHEET_DEFS confirms a real 'المهام'
 *     sheet exists — see "SYNC" note below)
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The fifth concrete, entity-aware Repository. It subclasses the generic
 *   Repository base class (js/core/Repository.js) and adds ONLY Tasks
 *   business knowledge: the "رقم_المهمة" identifier field (hybrid id per
 *   Data_Schema_Specification §3.2 — generated via a uid()-equivalent when
 *   absent, exactly as saveTask() does today), the single field ACTUALLY
 *   required today by saveTask() (`العنوان` — no discrepancy with either
 *   planning report this time), and the actual free-text search behavior
 *   enforced today by renderTasks().
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
 *   - It does NOT modify js/core/Repository.js, js/core/CasesRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ClientsRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ChildrenRepository.js, or
 *     js/repositories/SessionsRepository.js.
 *   - It does NOT modify js/modules/tasks.js, js/modules/cases.js,
 *     js/modules/clients.js, js/modules/children.js,
 *     js/modules/sessions.js, js/modules/documents.js, js/modules/fees.js,
 *     js/modules/library.js, js/modules/templates.js,
 *     js/modules/dashboard.js, js/modules/settings.js, index.html, any CSS,
 *     or Code_v4.gs.
 *   - It is NOT wired into index.html in this phase (no <script> tag
 *     references it) — pure additive file, inert until a later Migration
 *     Contract stage (Repository_Contract_Report.md §16).
 *   - It does NOT implement IndexedDB and does NOT call or reference
 *     DatabaseService or ApiService (no `syncToSheets()`/`API_URL`
 *     dependency — this Repository never syncs; see "SYNC" note below).
 *   - It does NOT implement a specialized `toggleStatus(id)` operation,
 *     despite `Repository_Contract_Report.md §4.6` explicitly proposing one
 *     to mirror `toggleTask()` — this phase's instructions list an exact,
 *     closed set of methods to implement ("نفذ فقط"), and `toggleStatus` is
 *     not among them. See "TOGGLE" note below.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * INPUT GAP — see Tasks_Repository_Report.md for the full table.
 *   Summary (unchanged since Phase 5.5, re-confirmed for this phase):
 *   `PROJECT_MAP.md` remains absent from the archive entirely.
 *   `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` and `NEXT_PHASE.md` remain available only under
 *   their numbered-duplicate filenames in doc/ (`PROJECT_HISTORY (5).md`,
 *   `NEXT_PHASE (5).md`). `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `PROJECT_STATE (7).md`
 *   remain a single, identical, up-to-date pair — both read and treated as
 *   one authoritative document here.
 *
 * STORAGE ADAPTER — a temporary, Tasks-scoped adapter (same decision
 *   pattern as Cases/Clients/Children/Sessions — each Repository still gets
 *   its own adapter; NEXT_PHASE.md still leaves "shared adapter vs.
 *   per-Repository adapter" as an open decision). Reads/writes the SAME
 *   localStorage key ('tasks') that index.html's global `data.tasks` /
 *   `saveLocal()` already use today.
 *
 * IDENTIFIER — the same documented reconciliation pattern already applied
 *   to Clients/Children/Sessions, now confirmed again for Tasks, exactly as
 *   `NEXT_PHASE.md` flagged as the first thing to check for this phase:
 *   Data_Schema_Specification §4.6 abstracts the Primary Key as generic
 *   `id` (Hybrid). Direct inspection of the ACTUAL saveTask() in
 *   js/modules/tasks.js (line 144) shows the generated identifier is
 *   stored under the Arabic field name "رقم_المهمة", not a generic "id":
 *     obj['رقم_المهمة'] = obj['رقم_المهمة'] || uid();
 *   Because this phase's explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100%
 *   مع Tasks Module الحالي", TasksRepository below configures
 *   `idField: 'رقم_المهمة'` (so every inherited Contract-literal method
 *   reads/writes the correct field name) and overrides `_resolveId()` to
 *   fall back to a local uid()-equivalent generator ONLY when 'رقم_المهمة'
 *   is absent on create — replicating saveTask()'s `|| uid()` fallback
 *   exactly, the same override pattern used in ClientsRepository.js /
 *   ChildrenRepository.js / SessionsRepository.js (not imported from any of
 *   them — see "NAMING/independence" note below).
 *
 * VALIDATION — **no discrepancy this time**, unlike Sessions (Phase 5.5).
 *   `Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.6` lists exactly one Required
 *   Field: `العنوان`. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL saveTask() (lines
 *   137-141) confirms exactly this:
 *     var t = document.getElementById('fTaskTitle').value.trim();
 *     if (!t) { toast('يرجى إدخال عنوان المهمة', 'error'); return; }
 *   (`t` maps via MAP.tasks to `العنوان`.) `_validate()` below enforces
 *   exactly this one field, non-empty after trim — no more, no less.
 *
 * SEARCH — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.6 states Search Fields
 *   are narrowly `العنوان` only. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL current
 *   renderTasks() (js/modules/tasks.js, lines 80-83) shows the claim
 *   UNDERSTATES the real behavior — same recurring pattern as
 *   Cases/Clients/Children/Sessions: it is not scoped to one field, it is
 *   the same full-record free-text join pattern:
 *     var rows = data.tasks.filter(function(t) {
 *       var tx = Object.values(t).join(' ').toLowerCase();
 *       return (!s || tx.includes(s)) && (!pr || t['الأولوية'] === pr);
 *     });
 *   bound to a real, live UI search box (`#searchTasks`). Because this
 *   phase's explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100% مع Tasks Module
 *   الحالي" — and because a live, wired UI control exercising this exact
 *   behavior today is stronger evidence than an abstract planning
 *   document's narrower field list — `_matchesSearch` is overridden here
 *   to replicate the actual free-text join across `TASKS_LEGACY_FIELDS`
 *   (excluding the new audit/metadata fields that did not exist in the
 *   record shape before this Repository layer, same reasoning as
 *   Cases/Clients/Children/Sessions). This divergence is called out
 *   explicitly in Tasks_Repository_Report.md §2.4.
 *
 * FILTER — renderTasks() also applies a second, independent condition in
 *   the SAME filter callback: `t['الأولوية'] === pr` (a priority dropdown,
 *   `#filterTaskPriority`) — the only filter dropdown that actually exists
 *   in index.html for Tasks today. Data_Schema_Specification §4.6 /
 *   Repository_Contract_Report §4.6 both additionally list `الحالة`
 *   (status) as a documented Filter Field, but direct inspection of
 *   index.html confirms **no `#filterTaskStatus` (or equivalent) element
 *   exists anywhere** — status filtering is not wired to any live UI
 *   control today (only `toggleTask()`'s checkbox click reads/writes
 *   `الحالة` directly, which is a mutation, not a filter). This is a
 *   documented gap between the plans and the live UI, NOT a code
 *   discrepancy requiring reconciliation: the additive `filter()` wrapper
 *   below is a generic, data-driven pass-through (no field hardcoded, same
 *   pattern as every prior Repository's `filter()`), so it already
 *   supports both `{الأولوية: ...}` (matching the real, live dropdown) and
 *   `{الحالة: ...}` (matching the documented-but-not-yet-UI-wired pattern)
 *   without any entity-specific override needed.
 *
 * SORT — Data_Schema_Specification §4.6 lists `الموعد_النهائي` as the Sort
 *   Field. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL current renderTasks() (lines
 *   80-83) shows NO `.sort()` call exists at all — tasks render in
 *   insertion order only, identical in kind to Children's Phase 5.4 finding
 *   (`renderChildren()` also applies no sort). Because this phase's
 *   explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100%", the additive `sort()`
 *   method below does not replace or emulate any existing behavior — it is
 *   a genuinely new capability, defaulting to `الموعد_النهائي` ascending
 *   (missing/unparseable due dates sort first) exactly as
 *   Data_Schema_Specification recommends, since no real behavior exists to
 *   contradict it (unlike Sessions' Phase 5.5 single-vs-composite
 *   reconciliation, where a real sort already existed to defer to).
 *
 * TOGGLE — `Repository_Contract_Report.md §4.6` explicitly proposes a
 *   specialized `toggleStatus(id)` operation mirroring the ACTUAL
 *   `toggleTask()` (a partial, single-field status flip, deliberately NOT
 *   a full `update()` — described there as a performance optimization to
 *   avoid sending an entire record over the network for a one-field
 *   change). This phase's instructions enumerate an exact, closed set of
 *   methods to implement ("نفذ فقط: getAll/get/insert/update/remove/
 *   exists/count/search/filter/sort/validate") — `toggleStatus` is not
 *   among them, and this phase does not add methods beyond that list.
 *   `toggleTask()`'s exact semantics (flip 'done'⇄'pending', no
 *   ApiService sync) therefore remain entirely inside
 *   `js/modules/tasks.js`, untouched and unreplicated here. A caller
 *   wanting the same effect through this Repository today would use the
 *   already-present `update(id, {'الحالة': newStatus})` — functionally
 *   equivalent but not the same partial-network-payload optimization the
 *   Contract report envisions. This is a deliberate, documented scope
 *   exclusion for this phase, not an oversight — see
 *   Tasks_Repository_Report.md §2.6.
 *
 * SYNC — Code_v4.gs's SHEET_DEFS confirms a real 'المهام' sheet DOES exist
 *   in the Apps Script backend, and js/modules/tasks.js's saveTask() calls
 *   `ApiService.syncRow('المهام', obj, idx)` (create/update ARE synced) —
 *   but `deleteTask()` does NOT call `ApiService.deleteData()`/
 *   `syncDeleteToSheets()` at all (a pre-existing, already-documented gap,
 *   matching `Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.6`'s
 *   `"syncPolicy" حذف = local-only` and `PROJECT_STATE.md §11`'s
 *   "Documents/Tasks/Fees delete-sync gap"). This does not change anything
 *   about this Repository's scope: this phase's instructions forbid adding
 *   any Sync here regardless, consistent with
 *   CasesRepository/ClientsRepository/ChildrenRepository/SessionsRepository
 *   (none of which sync either) — it is a pure localStorage CRUD layer.
 *   Nothing here forecloses wiring a sync layer on top of this Repository
 *   later without changing its Contract.
 *
 * NAMING / independence — same reconciliation as CasesRepository.js,
 *   ClientsRepository.js, ChildrenRepository.js, and SessionsRepository.js
 *   (see their header "NAMING"/"IDENTIFIER" notes): every Contract-literal
 *   method (create/update/delete/get/getAll/find/exists/count/bulkInsert/
 *   bulkUpdate/bulkDelete/search/export/import/clear/transaction) is
 *   inherited UNCHANGED from Repository.prototype. insert()/remove()/
 *   filter()/sort()/validate() are additive convenience wrappers requested
 *   by this phase's instructions, not renamed or removed Contract methods.
 *   This file does not import or reference ClientsRepository.js/
 *   CasesRepository.js/ChildrenRepository.js/SessionsRepository.js in any
 *   way — its local uid()-equivalent generator and Storage Adapter are
 *   self-contained duplicates of the same pattern, not shared code, per
 *   this phase's "depends only on Repository.js" instruction.
 *
 * Load order: additive file, not yet wired into index.html. Depends only on
 * js/core/Repository.js having been loaded first (throws a clear error
 * otherwise — see guard below).
