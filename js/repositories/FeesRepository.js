 * FeesRepository.js — Fees Repository | نظام الحسام للمحاماة
 * ================================================================
 * V10 — Offline First Architecture
 * PHASE 5 — SUB-PHASE 5.7 — Fees Repository
 *
 * Source of design (no assumption outside these — see Input Gap in
 * Fees_Repository_Report.md):
 *   - Repository_Contract_Report_PHASE2_V10.md  (Contract §3, Catalog §4.5,
 *     Standards §19 — literal operation names, no synonyms)
 *   - Data_Schema_Specification_Report_PHASE4_V10.md (§4.5 Fees: Primary
 *     Key, Required Fields, Search/Sort/Filter Fields, Delete/Sync Rules)
 *   - js/core/Repository.js (Repository Core — Phase 5.1, extended here,
 *     never modified)
 *   - js/core/CasesRepository.js, js/repositories/ClientsRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ChildrenRepository.js, js/core/SessionsRepository.js,
 *     js/core/TasksRepository.js (Phases 5.2/5.3/5.4/5.5/5.6 — the pattern
 *     reused again here: temporary localStorage Adapter, additive
 *     insert/remove/filter/sort/validate wrappers, documented deviations
 *     resolved in favor of actual runtime behavior — none of these five
 *     files read for implementation details beyond this pattern; none
 *     modified, none imported from)
 *   - Direct inspection of js/modules/fees.js (actual current runtime
 *     behavior of saveFee()/deleteFee()/editFee()/renderFees() — ground
 *     truth for the "100% Behavior Compatible" requirement of this phase)
 *   - Direct inspection of index.html (FIELDS.fees / MAP.fees field
 *     definitions, `data.fees` localStorage wiring, `#searchFees` — no
 *     fee-status, payment-method, amount-range, or date-range filter
 *     control of any kind exists anywhere for Fees)
 *   - Direct inspection of Code_v4.gs (SHEET_DEFS confirms a real
 *     'الأتعاب' sheet exists, headers order — see "SYNC"/"IDENTIFIER"
 *     notes below)
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The sixth concrete, entity-aware Repository. It subclasses the generic
 *   Repository base class (js/core/Repository.js) and adds ONLY Fees
 *   business knowledge: the "رقم_العملية" identifier field (hybrid id per
 *   Data_Schema_Specification §3.2 — generated via a uid()-equivalent when
 *   absent, exactly as saveFee() does today), the two fields ACTUALLY
 *   required today by saveFee() (`رقم_القضية` and `المبلغ`), and the
 *   actual free-text search behavior enforced today by renderFees().
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
 *   - It does NOT modify js/core/Repository.js, js/core/CasesRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ClientsRepository.js,
 *     js/repositories/ChildrenRepository.js, js/core/SessionsRepository.js,
 *     or js/core/TasksRepository.js.
 *   - It does NOT modify js/modules/fees.js, js/modules/cases.js,
 *     js/modules/clients.js, js/modules/children.js,
 *     js/modules/sessions.js, js/modules/documents.js, js/modules/tasks.js,
 *     js/modules/library.js, js/modules/templates.js,
 *     js/modules/dashboard.js, js/modules/settings.js, index.html, any CSS,
 *     or Code_v4.gs.
 *   - It is NOT wired into index.html in this phase (no <script> tag
 *     references it) — pure additive file, inert until a later Migration
 *     Contract stage (Repository_Contract_Report.md §16).
 *   - It does NOT implement IndexedDB and does NOT call or reference
 *     DatabaseService or ApiService (no `syncToSheets()`/`API_URL`
 *     dependency — this Repository never syncs; see "SYNC" note below).
 *   - It does NOT transfer any Business Logic (totals aggregation,
 *     currency formatting, modal wiring) out of js/modules/fees.js — that
 *     stays exactly where it is, untouched.
 *   - It does NOT add any Cache or Sync layer of any kind.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * INPUT GAP — see Fees_Repository_Report.md §1 for the full table.
 *   Summary (unchanged since Phase 5.6, re-confirmed for this phase):
 *   `PROJECT_MAP.md` remains absent from the archive entirely.
 *   `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` and `NEXT_PHASE.md` remain available only under
 *   their numbered-duplicate filenames in doc/. `PROJECT_STATE.md` is
 *   likewise only present under a numbered-duplicate filename. All three
 *   were read and treated as the authoritative documents regardless.
 *   ADDITIONALLY, and specific to this phase: the five prior Repository
 *   files this phase's instructions require as reference
 *   (`CasesRepository.js`, `SessionsRepository.js`, `TasksRepository.js`)
 *   are physically located at `js/core/` in the delivered archive, NOT at
 *   `js/repositories/` as their own file headers, Tasks_Repository_Report.md
 *   §1, and NEXT_PHASE.md's own prose all state. Only
 *   `ClientsRepository.js` and `ChildrenRepository.js` are physically
 *   present under `js/repositories/`. This is a packaging discrepancy in
 *   the delivered archive, not a code change — the content of each file
 *   was read and used as read (MD5-verified identical to the values
 *   Tasks_Repository_Report.md §5 already recorded for four of the five),
 *   and NONE of them were moved, renamed, or edited by this phase. This
 *   phase's own deliverable is created at the exact path its instructions
 *   specify: `js/repositories/FeesRepository.js`.
 *
 * STORAGE ADAPTER — a temporary, Fees-scoped adapter (same decision
 *   pattern as Cases/Clients/Children/Sessions/Tasks — each Repository
 *   still gets its own adapter; NEXT_PHASE.md still leaves "shared adapter
 *   vs. per-Repository adapter" as an open decision). Reads/writes the
 *   SAME localStorage key ('fees') that index.html's global `data.fees` /
 *   `saveLocal()` already use today.
 *
 * IDENTIFIER — the same documented reconciliation pattern already applied
 *   to Clients/Children/Sessions/Tasks, now confirmed again for Fees,
 *   exactly as NEXT_PHASE.md flagged as the first thing to check for this
 *   phase: Data_Schema_Specification §4.5 abstracts the Primary Key as
 *   generic `id` (Hybrid). Direct inspection of the ACTUAL saveFee() in
 *   js/modules/fees.js shows the generated identifier is stored under the
 *   Arabic field name "رقم_العملية", not a generic "id":
 *     obj['رقم_العملية'] = obj['رقم_العملية'] || uid();
 *   Confirmed independently by Code_v4.gs's SHEET_DEFS for sheet 'الأتعاب',
 *   whose first header column is literally 'رقم_العملية'. Because this
 *   phase's explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100% مع Fees Module
 *   الحالي", FeesRepository below configures `idField: 'رقم_العملية'` (so
 *   every inherited Contract-literal method reads/writes the correct field
 *   name) and overrides `_resolveId()` to fall back to a local
 *   uid()-equivalent generator ONLY when 'رقم_العملية' is absent on
 *   create — replicating saveFee()'s `|| uid()` fallback exactly, the same
 *   override pattern used in ClientsRepository.js/ChildrenRepository.js/
 *   SessionsRepository.js/TasksRepository.js (not imported from any of
 *   them — see "NAMING/independence" note below).
 *
 * VALIDATION — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.5 lists two Required
 *   Fields: `رقم_القضية` and `المبلغ` — no discrepancy with the actual
 *   code this time (same as Tasks, Phase 5.6). Direct inspection of the
 *   ACTUAL saveFee() (js/modules/fees.js) confirms exactly this:
 *     var c = document.getElementById('fFeeCaseNum').value.trim();
 *     var a = document.getElementById('fFeeAmount').value;
 *     if (!c || !a) { toast('يرجى ملء رقم القضية والمبلغ', 'error'); return; }
 *   Note the asymmetry preserved deliberately below: `c` (رقم_القضية) is
 *   read via `.trim()` before the emptiness check, while `a` (المبلغ) is
 *   read WITHOUT `.trim()` — only a raw falsy check (`!a`, true for `''`,
 *   `null`, `undefined`, `0`, but NOT for the non-empty string `'0'` or a
 *   whitespace-only string like `'   '`, since a non-empty string is
 *   truthy in JavaScript regardless of its content). `_validate()` below
 *   reproduces this exact asymmetry field-by-field rather than applying a
 *   single uniform "non-empty after trim" rule to both fields, to stay
 *   byte-for-byte behavior compatible with the live form check. Also per
 *   Data_Schema_Specification §4.5: "`المبلغ` رقمي (توصية — لا فرض نوع
 *   صارم حالياً في الكود، الحقل نص HTML عادي)" — i.e. numeric-ness is
 *   explicitly a RECOMMENDATION only, not an enforced rule today. No
 *   numeric type check is added here, matching that explicit instruction
 *   and the actual code (which never calls `Number()`/`parseFloat()`
 *   before persisting `المبلغ` in saveFee() — only inside renderFees()'s
 *   display-only total/format calls, which are Business Logic this phase
 *   is forbidden from moving).
 *
 * SEARCH — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.5 states Search Fields
 *   are narrowly `اسم_الموكل`, `رقم_القضية`. Direct inspection of the
 *   ACTUAL current renderFees() (js/modules/fees.js) shows the claim
 *   UNDERSTATES the real behavior — same recurring pattern as
 *   Cases/Clients/Children/Sessions/Tasks: it is not scoped to two fields,
 *   it is the same full-record free-text join pattern:
 *     var rows = data.fees.filter(function(f) {
 *       return !s || Object.values(f).join(' ').toLowerCase().includes(s);
 *     });
 *   bound to a real, live UI search box (`#searchFees`). Because this
 *   phase's explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100% مع Fees Module
 *   الحالي" — and because a live, wired UI control exercising this exact
 *   behavior today is stronger evidence than an abstract planning
 *   document's narrower field list — `_matchesSearch` is overridden here
 *   to replicate the actual free-text join across `FEES_LEGACY_FIELDS`
 *   (excluding the new audit/metadata fields that did not exist in the
 *   record shape before this Repository layer, same reasoning as
 *   Cases/Clients/Children/Sessions/Tasks). This divergence is called out
 *   explicitly in Fees_Repository_Report.md §2.4.
 *
 * FILTER — Data_Schema_Specification §4.5 / Repository_Contract_Report
 *   §4.5 both document Filter Fields for Fees as `رقم_القضية` and a range
 *   filter on `تاريخ_الاستلام` only. Direct inspection of index.html and
 *   renderFees() confirms there is NO live filter control of ANY kind for
 *   Fees today — not for case number, not for payment method
 *   (`طريقة_الدفع`), not for amount (`المبلغ`), and there is no status
 *   concept for Fees at all (no `الحالة` field exists anywhere in
 *   FEES_FIELDS/FEES_MAP, in index.html's fee form, or in Code_v4.gs's
 *   'الأتعاب' sheet headers — confirmed by grepping all three; this is a
 *   genuine absence, not an oversight to reconcile, and is documented
 *   verbatim as an Input Gap between this phase's instructions — which
 *   ask for a "Status Filter" test — and the live schema, in
 *   Fees_Repository_Report.md §2.5). Only the free-text search box
 *   (`#searchFees`) exists as a live query control. Exactly as with
 *   Tasks/Sessions/Children, the additive `filter()` wrapper below is a
 *   generic, data-driven pass-through (no field hardcoded), so it already
 *   supports `{رقم_القضية: ...}` (documented), `{طريقة_الدفع: ...}` and
 *   range filters on `{المبلغ: {op, value}}` / `{تاريخ_الاستلام: {op,
 *   value}}` (all real fields, even though undocumented as Filter Fields)
 *   without any entity-specific override needed. A `{الحالة: ...}` filter
 *   is also accepted by the same generic engine without throwing, but
 *   will simply match zero records against real data today, since no fee
 *   record has ever carried that key — this is the harness's basis for
 *   the required "Status Filter" verification test (§2.5 of the report),
 *   proving graceful, non-crashing behavior rather than fabricating a
 *   status field that does not exist in the live application.
 *
 * SORT — Data_Schema_Specification §4.5 lists `تاريخ_الاستلام` as the Sort
 *   Field. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL current renderFees() shows NO
 *   `.sort()` call exists at all — fee rows render in `data.fees`
 *   insertion order only, identical in kind to Children's Phase 5.4 and
 *   Tasks' Phase 5.6 findings. Because this phase's explicit priority is
 *   "Behavior Compatible 100%", the additive `sort()` method below does
 *   not replace or emulate any existing behavior — it is a genuinely new
 *   capability, defaulting to `تاريخ_الاستلام` ascending (missing/
 *   unparseable receipt dates sort first) exactly as
 *   Data_Schema_Specification recommends, since no real behavior exists
 *   to contradict it.
 *
 * SYNC — Code_v4.gs's SHEET_DEFS confirms a real 'الأتعاب' sheet DOES
 *   exist in the Apps Script backend, and js/modules/fees.js's saveFee()
 *   calls `ApiService.syncRow('الأتعاب', obj, idx)` (create/update ARE
 *   synced) — but `deleteFee()` does NOT call `ApiService.deleteData()`/
 *   `syncDeleteToSheets()` at all (a pre-existing, already-documented gap
 *   — the fees.js file's own inline comment above `deleteFee()` names this
 *   explicitly, matching `Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.5`'s
 *   `"syncPolicy" حذف = local-only` and the "Documents/Tasks/Fees
 *   delete-sync gap" noted project-wide). This does not change anything
 *   about this Repository's scope: this phase's instructions forbid
 *   adding any Sync here regardless, consistent with every prior
 *   Repository (none of which sync either) — it is a pure localStorage
 *   CRUD layer. Nothing here forecloses wiring a sync layer on top of this
 *   Repository later without changing its Contract.
 *
 * NAMING / independence — same reconciliation as CasesRepository.js,
 *   ClientsRepository.js, ChildrenRepository.js, SessionsRepository.js,
 *   and TasksRepository.js (see their header "NAMING"/"IDENTIFIER"
 *   notes): every Contract-literal method (create/update/delete/get/
 *   getAll/find/exists/count/bulkInsert/bulkUpdate/bulkDelete/search/
 *   export/import/clear/transaction) is inherited UNCHANGED from
 *   Repository.prototype. insert()/remove()/filter()/sort()/validate()
 *   are additive convenience wrappers requested by this phase's
 *   instructions, not renamed or removed Contract methods. This file does
 *   not import or reference ClientsRepository.js/CasesRepository.js/
 *   ChildrenRepository.js/SessionsRepository.js/TasksRepository.js in any
 *   way — its local uid()-equivalent generator and Storage Adapter are
 *   self-contained duplicates of the same pattern, not shared code, per
 *   this phase's "depends only on Repository.js" instruction.
 *
 * Load order: additive file, not yet wired into index.html. Depends only on
 * js/core/Repository.js having been loaded first (throws a clear error
 * otherwise — see guard below).
