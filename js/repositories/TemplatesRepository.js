 * TemplatesRepository.js — Templates Repository | نظام الحسام للمحاماة
 * ================================================================
 * V10 — Offline First Architecture
 * PHASE 5 — SUB-PHASE 5.10.2 — Templates Repository (Build)
 * (يلي مباشرة PHASE 5 / SUB-PHASE 5.10.1 — Templates Repository Audit,
 *  READ-ONLY، الذي أُنتِج في هذه المحادثة قبل هذا الملف)
 *
 * Source of design (no assumption outside these — see Input Gap in
 * Templates_Repository_Report.md):
 *   - Repository_Contract_Report_PHASE2_V10.md  (Contract §3, Catalog §4.9,
 *     Standards §19 — literal operation names, no synonyms)
 *   - Data_Schema_Specification_Report_PHASE4_V10.md (§4.9 Templates:
 *     Primary Key, Required Fields, Search/Sort/Filter Fields, Delete/Sync
 *     Rules)
 *   - js/core/Repository.js (Repository Core — Phase 5.1, extended here,
 *     never modified)
 *   - js/repositories/CasesRepository.js, ClientsRepository.js,
 *     ChildrenRepository.js, SessionsRepository.js, TasksRepository.js,
 *     FeesRepository.js, DocumentsRepository.js (Phases 5.2–5.8 — the
 *     pattern reused again here: temporary localStorage Adapter, additive
 *     insert/remove/filter/sort/validate wrappers, documented deviations
 *     resolved in favor of actual runtime behavior — none of these seven
 *     files read for implementation details beyond this pattern; none
 *     modified, none imported from)
 *   - Direct inspection of js/modules/templates.js (actual current
 *     runtime behavior of saveTemplate()/deleteTemplate()/editTemplate()/
 *     filterTemplates()/renderTemplates() — ground truth for the "100%
 *     Behavior Compatible" requirement of this phase)
 *   - Direct inspection of index.html (FIELDS.templates / MAP.templates
 *     field definitions, `data.templates` localStorage wiring,
 *     `#templateTabs` — no free-text search box of any kind exists
 *     anywhere for Templates)
 *   - Direct inspection of Code_v4.gs (SHEET_DEFS — see "SYNC" note below)
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The eighth concrete, entity-aware Repository built in this sequence.
 *   (NOTE: per NEXT_PHASE.md's own documented migration order — Library →
 *   Templates → Fees → ... — Library Repository was meant to precede this
 *   one. The archive audited in Phase 5.10.1 contained no
 *   LibraryRepository.js / Library_Repository_Report.md at all. This file
 *   does not depend on Library in any way — see "INPUT GAP" note below —
 *   so its own correctness is unaffected, but the numbering "eighth" is
 *   provisional pending that separate gap being resolved.)
 *   It subclasses the generic Repository base class (js/core/Repository.js)
 *   and adds ONLY Templates business knowledge: the generic `id` (Hybrid)
 *   identifier field, the two fields ACTUALLY required today by
 *   saveTemplate() (`العنوان` and `القسم`), and an explicitly-decided
 *   free-text search policy (see "SEARCH" note — no live precedent exists
 *   to replicate, unlike every prior entity).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
 *   - It does NOT modify js/core/Repository.js, CasesRepository.js,
 *     ClientsRepository.js, ChildrenRepository.js, SessionsRepository.js,
 *     TasksRepository.js, FeesRepository.js, or DocumentsRepository.js.
 *   - It does NOT modify js/modules/templates.js, index.html, any CSS, or
 *     Code_v4.gs.
 *   - It is NOT wired into index.html in this phase (no <script> tag
 *     references it) — pure additive file, inert until a later Migration
 *     Contract stage (Repository_Contract_Report.md §16).
 *   - It does NOT implement IndexedDB and does NOT call or reference
 *     DatabaseService or ApiService (no `syncToSheets()`/`API_URL`
 *     dependency — this Repository never syncs; see "SYNC" note below).
 *   - It does NOT transfer any DOM/rendering logic (tab-bar construction,
 *     card HTML, modal wiring) out of js/modules/templates.js — that stays
 *     exactly where it is, untouched.
 *   - It does NOT resolve, remove, or paper over the Library Repository
 *     sequencing gap noted above — out of scope for this file.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * INPUT GAP — see Templates_Repository_Report.md §1 for the full table.
 *   Summary: the archive audited for Phase 5.10.1 ends at Documents
 *   Repository (5.8) in PROJECT_STATE.md/NEXT_PHASE.md and contains no
 *   LibraryRepository.js, Library_Repository_Report.md, or
 *   verify_library_repository.js at all, despite NEXT_PHASE.md's own
 *   documented next-step and migration-order sections naming Library
 *   before Templates. This is a project-sequencing gap, not a defect in
 *   Templates itself — every Repository in this project (Cases through
 *   Documents) is independently self-contained and depends only on
 *   js/core/Repository.js, never on a sibling Repository, so building
 *   TemplatesRepository.js without Library existing yet introduces no
 *   broken dependency. The gap is documented here for traceability and
 *   must still be closed (Library Repository built) before this project's
 *   own migration-order documentation is internally consistent again.
 *
 *   ADDITIONALLY, and specific to Templates: both planning documents
 *   (Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.9 and
 *   Repository_Contract_Report.md §4.9) state Templates' Sync Priority as
 *   "معطَّل بالكامل تصميماً — لا Sheet مقابل أصلاً" ("no corresponding
 *   Sheet exists at all"). Direct inspection of Code_v4.gs's SHEET_DEFS
 *   shows this is not literally true: a Sheet definition named 'الصيغ'
 *   DOES exist there, with headers identical in shape to the dormant
 *   'المكتبة' (Library) Sheet definition immediately preceding it
 *   (['id','العنوان','النوع','القسم','الرابط','الوصف','تاريخ_الإنشاء']).
 *   Neither Sheet is referenced by js/api/api.js's loadAllSheets() (which
 *   lists only 6 pairs: القضايا/الجلسات/الموكلين/المستندات/المهام/
 *   الأتعاب — plus الأطفال handled separately per ChildrenRepository.js's
 *   own file header), and js/modules/templates.js never calls
 *   syncToSheets()/syncDeleteToSheets()/ApiService in any form — so the
 *   FUNCTIONAL conclusion (no sync happens today) is correct, but the
 *   REASON given in both planning documents ("no Sheet exists") is
 *   factually wrong; the accurate description is "a dormant, unwired
 *   Sheet definition exists but is never loaded or synced" — the exact
 *   same situation already correctly documented for Library. This
 *   Repository's behavior is unaffected either way (it never syncs
 *   regardless of which description is accurate), but the correction is
 *   recorded here so it is not silently propagated forward.
 *
 * STORAGE ADAPTER — a temporary, Templates-scoped adapter (same decision
 *   pattern as every prior Repository — each one still gets its own
 *   adapter; NEXT_PHASE.md still leaves "shared adapter vs.
 *   per-Repository adapter" as an open decision). Reads/writes the SAME
 *   localStorage key ('templates') that index.html's global
 *   `data.templates` / `saveLocal()` already use today.
 *
 * IDENTIFIER — unlike every entity from Clients through Documents
 *   (Phases 5.3–5.8), which all reconciled an abstractly-documented `id`
 *   down to a real Arabic-named field, Templates is the first entity in
 *   this sequence confirmed to genuinely use the generic field name `id`
 *   at runtime. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL saveTemplate() in
 *   js/modules/templates.js confirms:
 *     obj['id'] = obj['id'] || uid();
 *   with no Arabic-named alternative anywhere in FIELDS.templates,
 *   MAP.templates, or Code_v4.gs's dormant 'الصيغ' Sheet headers (whose
 *   first column is literally 'id', matching 'المكتبة''s own first column
 *   for Library — see file header "INPUT GAP" note). Because this phase's
 *   explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100% مع Templates Module
 *   الحالي", TemplatesRepository below configures `idField: 'id'` (no
 *   Arabic-field override needed) and overrides `_resolveId()` only to
 *   replicate the `|| uid()` hybrid-generation fallback — the same
 *   override *shape* used in every prior Repository, just against the
 *   literal field `id` instead of an Arabic key this time.
 *
 * VALIDATION — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.9 lists exactly ONE
 *   Required Field: `العنوان` (and separately lists `القسم` under Optional
 *   Fields). Direct inspection of the ACTUAL saveTemplate() (
 *   js/modules/templates.js) contradicts this — TWO fields are checked,
 *   both via `.trim()` (a symmetric pair, same shape as Documents 5.8, no
 *   asymmetry like Fees 5.7):
 *     var t = document.getElementById('fTplTitle').value.trim();  // العنوان
 *     var c = document.getElementById('fTplCat').value.trim();    // القسم
 *     if (!t || !c) { toast('يرجى ملء الاسم والقسم', 'error'); return; }
 *   Independently corroborated by index.html's form markup: both
 *   `fTplTitle` and `fTplCat` carry a `<span class="req">*</span>`
 *   required-field marker; `fTplUrl`/`fTplDesc` do not. Because this
 *   phase's explicit priority is "Behavior Compatible 100%", `_validate()`
 *   below enforces BOTH fields, resolving the documented single-field
 *   claim in favor of the live, UI-confirmed two-field behavior — the same
 *   resolution approach already used for Sessions' §4.4 discrepancy
 *   (Phase 5.5). Full rationale: Templates_Repository_Report.md §2.3.
 *
 * SEARCH — Data_Schema_Specification_Report.md §4.9 states Search Fields
 *   are `العنوان`, `الوصف`. Direct inspection of the ACTUAL current
 *   templates.js (confirmed independently by PROJECT_HISTORY.md's own
 *   Phase 11A entry: "Confirmed no search box/function ever existed for
 *   Templates") shows there is NO free-text search implementation at all
 *   — not narrower than documented (as with every prior entity's
 *   deviation), but entirely ABSENT. Templates' only query mechanism is
 *   the category-tab filter (`filterTemplates(cat)` / `#templateTabs`).
 *   This is the first entity in the whole Phase 5 sequence with zero live
 *   search behavior to replicate either way. Per
 *   Templates_Repository_Report.md §2.4, the explicit decision made here
 *   is: implement the SAME generic full-record free-text join pattern
 *   already established for every prior entity (`Object.values(record)
 *   .join(' ')`), scoped to Templates' legacy business fields, as a
 *   genuinely ADDITIVE new capability (not a replication of existing
 *   behavior, since none exists) — consistent with how sort() was already
 *   added additively for Children/Tasks/Fees/Documents where no live sort
 *   existed. This is a documented design choice, not a silent assumption
 *   — an alternative (no search support at all, throwing
 *   UnsupportedOperationError) was considered and rejected because it
 *   would make TemplatesRepository behave inconsistently with every
 *   sibling Repository's search() Contract method for no compatibility
 *   benefit (there is nothing live to stay compatible with either way).
 *
 * FILTER — Data_Schema_Specification §4.9 / Repository_Contract_Report
 *   §4.9 both document Filter Fields for Templates as `النوع` and `القسم`.
 *   Direct inspection of index.html and renderTemplates() confirms:
 *     - `القسم` IS live and wired — dynamically-built category tabs
 *       (`#templateTabs`, built from `[...new Set(data.templates.map(t =>
 *       t['القسم']))]`) drive `filterTemplates(cat)` → `currentTplFilter`
 *       → `renderTemplates()`'s own `.filter()` call. Real, active
 *       filtering, exact-match on `القسم`.
 *     - `النوع` is documented but NOT wired to any filter control — it is
 *       used only to render a type badge/icon per card (`word`/`pdf`/
 *       `other`), never to narrow the list. Same "documented field, no
 *       live UI control" pattern already seen for `رقم_القضية` in
 *       Fees/Documents (Phases 5.7/5.8).
 *   The additive `filter()` wrapper below is a generic, data-driven
 *   pass-through (no field hardcoded), so it already supports both
 *   `{القسم: ...}` (live) and `{النوع: ...}` (documented, unwired) without
 *   any entity-specific override needed — same pattern as every prior
 *   Repository's filter().
 *
 * SORT — Data_Schema_Specification §4.9 lists `العنوان` as the Sort Field.
 *   Direct inspection of the ACTUAL current renderTemplates() shows NO
 *   `.sort()` call exists at all — templates render in `data.templates`
 *   insertion order only (after category filtering), identical in kind to
 *   Children/Tasks/Fees/Documents' prior findings. The additive `sort()`
 *   method below does not replace or emulate any existing behavior — it
 *   is a genuinely new capability, defaulting to `العنوان` ascending
 *   exactly as Data_Schema_Specification recommends, since no real
 *   behavior exists to contradict it.
 *
 * SYNC — Code_v4.gs's SHEET_DEFS shows a dormant Sheet definition named
 *   'الصيغ' exists (see file header "INPUT GAP" note above for the full
 *   correction of both planning documents' "no Sheet at all" claim), but
 *   it is never referenced by js/api/api.js's loadAllSheets(), and
 *   js/modules/templates.js's saveTemplate()/deleteTemplate() never call
 *   ApiService/syncToSheets/syncDeleteToSheets in any form — functionally
 *   local-only, matching Library's already-documented characteristic
 *   exactly. This Repository adds no Sync layer of any kind, consistent
 *   with every prior Repository (none of which sync either) — it is a
 *   pure localStorage CRUD layer. Nothing here forecloses wiring a sync
 *   layer on top of either this Repository or the dormant 'الصيغ' Sheet
 *   later, without changing this Repository's Contract.
 *
 * DEAD CODE NOTE — js/modules/templates.js declares its own
 *   `TEMPLATES_FIELDS`/`TEMPLATES_MAP` constants (lines 51–65), but
 *   `collectForm()`/`fillForm()`/`resetForm()` (js/print-utils.js) read
 *   from the GLOBAL `FIELDS.templates`/`MAP.templates` defined in
 *   index.html instead — confirmed identical in content by direct
 *   comparison, but confirmed by grep that `TEMPLATES_FIELDS`/
 *   `TEMPLATES_MAP` are never referenced anywhere at runtime (dead,
 *   duplicate constants, explicitly permitted to remain per
 *   PROJECT_HISTORY.md §Phase 11B: "FIELDS.templates/MAP.templates may be
 *   left in place"). This Repository does not import, reference, or rely
 *   on either copy — its own field knowledge (TEMPLATES_ID_FIELD,
 *   TEMPLATES_REQUIRED_FIELDS, etc. below) is derived directly from
 *   saveTemplate()'s live runtime checks, not from either FIELDS/MAP
 *   object.
 *
 * NAMING / independence — same reconciliation as every prior Repository
 *   (see their own header "NAMING"/"IDENTIFIER" notes): every
 *   Contract-literal method (create/update/delete/get/getAll/find/exists/
 *   count/bulkInsert/bulkUpdate/bulkDelete/search/export/import/clear/
 *   transaction) is inherited UNCHANGED from Repository.prototype.
 *   insert()/remove()/filter()/sort()/validate() are additive convenience
 *   wrappers requested by this phase's instructions, not renamed or
 *   removed Contract methods. This file does not import or reference
 *   CasesRepository.js/ClientsRepository.js/ChildrenRepository.js/
 *   SessionsRepository.js/TasksRepository.js/FeesRepository.js/
 *   DocumentsRepository.js in any way — its local uid()-equivalent
 *   generator and Storage Adapter are self-contained duplicates of the
 *   same pattern, not shared code, per this phase's "depends only on
 *   Repository.js" instruction.
 *
 * Load order: additive file, not yet wired into index.html. Depends only
 * on js/core/Repository.js having been loaded first (throws a clear error
 * otherwise — see guard below).
